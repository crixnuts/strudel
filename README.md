# Strudel Compositions

This repository contains a collection of my original musical compositions created using **Strudel (strudel.cc)**.  
They are stored here for safekeeping, versioning, and sharing with anyone interested in live-coding music.

## About

Each file in this repository represents a musical idea, pattern, or full composition written in Strudel’s
TidalCycles-inspired syntax. These works are original and reflect my creative expression through algorithmic music.
